# bdd_ui_framework_selenium
BDD framework using Selenium

# Motivation
I like Behave so I've decided to use it with Selenium WebDriver.

# Demo
TODO

# Libraries Used
Behave - A BDD testing tool for Python.
Selenium WebDriver - A UI Automation Testing Tool.
Invoke - A taskrunner (Runs cyclical tasks for us).
PyYaml - A yaml parser.

# Prerequisites
Pipenv and Python installed on your machine.

# Setup
From the project root use pipenv to install the needed libraries and
then go into the virtual environment.

## Steps
Check that you are in the project root:
```console
$ pwd
```

You see an output like the following:

```shell
.../bdd_ui_framework_selenium
```
Change into pipenv environment:

```console
$ pipenv shell
```

You should see something like this once you are in the virtual environment.

```console
$ (bdd_ui_framework_selenium) ......
```

Then we install the dependencies

```console
$ pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```
END OF SETUP

# Usage
